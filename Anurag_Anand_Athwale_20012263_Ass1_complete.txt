--Q5)Show for each customer and product combination, the total sales quantities for 4

--ignore the YEAR component of the dates (i.e., 3/11/2001 is considered the same date
--as 3/11/2002, etc.). Also compute the average for the “whole” year (again ignoring
--the YEAR component, meaning simply compute AVG) along with the total quantities
--(SUM) and the counts (COUNT)
